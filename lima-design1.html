                I am a freelance graphic designer and photographer based in Los Angeles, CA. I have a BFA in Graphic
                Design from the Maryland Institute College of Art and an MFA in Graphic Design from the California
                Institute of the Arts. I have worked as a graphic designer and photographer for over 10 years, and have
                been teaching design and photography classes at the college level for the past 5 years. I am passionate
                about both design and photography, and love to combine the two disciplines in my work. I believe that
                good design should be both beautiful and functional, and that good photography should tell a story and
                capture a moment in time.
